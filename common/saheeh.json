(Ar-Raḥmān and ar-Raḥeem are two names of Allāh derived from the word \"raḥmah\" (mercy) . In Arabic grammar both are intensive forms of \"merciful\" (i.e., extremely merciful) . A complimentary and comprehensive meaning is intended by using both together. Raḥmān is used only to describe Allāh, while raḥeem might be used to describe a person as well. The Prophet (ﷺ) was described in the Qur’ān as raḥeem. Raḥmān is above the human level (i.e., intensely merciful) . Since one usually understands intensity to be something of short duration, Allāh describes Himself also as raḥeem (i.e., continually merciful) . Raḥmān also carries a wider meaning - merciful to all creation. Justice is a part of this mercy. Raḥeem includes the concept of speciality - especially and specifically merciful to the believers. Forgiveness is a part of this mercy. In addition, Raḥmān is adjectival, referring to an attribute of Allāh and is part of His essence. Raḥeem is verbal, indicating what He does: i.e., bestowing and implementing mercy.)"

(i.e., Allāh's command to the Prophet (ﷺ) to marry Zaynab after Zayd divorced her.  This was to demonstrate that a man may marry a woman formerly married to his adopted son.) And you feared the people, (i.e., feared their saying that the Prophet (ﷺ) had married the (former) wife of his son (which is prohibited by Allāh in the case of a true, begotten son).) while Allāh has more right that you fear Him. (By making known His command.)
